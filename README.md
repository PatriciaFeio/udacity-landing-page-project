# Landing Page Project

# Demo

A demo of the project is available [here](https://patriciafeio.github.io/udacity-landing-page-project/).

# Introduction

This is the second mandatory project for the **Front End Developer Nanodegree Program** sponsored by the **Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster Scholarship Program**.

The aim of this project is to build a multi-section landing page where the user can navigate through each section using the navigation bar on the top.

# Project Description

This project was developed under the **JavaScript & The DOM** part of the **Front End Developer Nanodegree**. The purpose was to dynamically add content to the navigation menu and to improve usability.

# Installation

Installation is not required. The project can be cloned from [here](https://github.com/PatriciaFeio/udacity-landing-page-project).

# Usage

While the user scrolls through the page, the section that is being viewed and the corresponding navigation menu item are highlighted in some way.

When the user clicks a navigation menu item, the link scrolls smoothly to the appropriate section.

A scroll to top button is visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.

The fixed navigation bar is hidden while the user is not scrolling.

# Development

A started code was provided [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page) with a static, non-interactive version of the project. The aim was to develop all the JavaScript part.
