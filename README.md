# Landing Page Project

# Demo

A demo of the project is available [here]().

# Introduction

This is the second mandatory project for the **Front End Developer Nanodegree Program** sponsored by the **Bertelsmann Next Generation Tech Booster Scholarship Program**.

The aim of this project is to build a multi-section landing page where the user can navigate through each section using the navigation bar on the top.

# Project Description

This project was developed under the **JavaScript & The DOM** part of the **Front End Developer Nanodegree**. The purpose was to dynamically add content to the navigation menu and to improve the user experience differentiating in some way the section actively being viewed. Also, the item clicked on the navigation bar should smooth scroll the user to the appropriate section, instead of giving the default jump.
